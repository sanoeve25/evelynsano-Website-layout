         <h1>GROWTH AND YIELD PERFORMANCE OF TWO RICE VARIETIES (Oryza sativa) AS INFLUNCED BY ORGANIC FERTILIZER APPLICATION GROWN IN BRGY. PAGBALIKAN, CALBAYOG CITY.        
         <h2>CHAPTER 1</h2>
         <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3> 
         <body>
         <p>NATURE OF IMPORTANCE OF THE STUDY</p>
            Rice (Oryza sativa) is an annual crop i the Family Graminecea characterized by one flowered spikelet, laterally compressed and two short glumes.
         <br>
         <p> A plant that produces an edible grain, the name is also used for the grain itself. Rice is the most important food crop and the major dietary component for more than a third of the world's population. It serves as ingredients manufacturing foods such as puff rice, flakes, and native dilicacies. It is also used for animal feeds and pet food, edible oil for cooking and other products. (Department of Agriculture, 1988).<p>
         <p> According to the United Nations Food and Agricultute Organization (FAO 1998), rice supplies an average of 889 calories per day per person in China. In contrast, rice provides an average of 82 calories per day per person in United States. Rice is a nutritious food providing about 90% of calories from carbohydrates and as much 13% of calories from protein. </p>
         <p> Providing adequate supply of rice to the increasing population id one of the major problems in the country. Increasing rice production is a great challenge to farmers as well as agricultural institutions which are involved in researched and in the generation of appropriate technology over the country. It is not enough that the farmer knows the art of cultivating the crop but also the proper ways by which production and developing more areas, and by increasing the yield per unit area by following some of the recommended technologies in growing this crop.</p>
         <p> To meet the challenge of increasing productivity, farmer should know the most efficient cultural practices in cultivating this crop. Successful crop production depends on unddrstanding how crops develops and grow, how various factors affect plant growth and development and how each factors can be modified and managed, hence this study was conducted.</p>
         <br>
         <h3> Objective of the Study</h3>
         <p> This study was specifically conducted with the following objectives:</p>
         <p> 1. to compare and assess the effect of variety and differend kinds of organic fertilizer on the growth and yield of rice; </p>
         <p> 2. to determine the cost and return analysis of the rice as applied with different kinds of organic fertilizers</p>
         <br>
         <h3> Time and Place of the Study</h3>
         <p> Thus study was conducted from August to January, 2009 in the rice field located at Barangay Pagbalikan, Calbayog City.</p>
         <br>
         <h3> Limitation of the Study</h3>
         <p> The study covered the performance of two lowland rice varieties such as New42 and PSBRc18 as affectedby the application of different kinds of organic fertilizers such as Guano and vermin compost.</p>

                <p>I can see how much I learned by practicing HTML hands-on and exploring each tag directly in my code editor. Working through every line helped me understand website structure more clearly and boosted my cofidence in creating my own layout used this this reseach paper.</p>
