     Come stop your crying
     It will be alright
     Just take my hand
     Hold it tight

     I will protect you
     From all around you
     I will be here
     Don't you cry

     For one so small
     You seem so strong
     My arms will hold you
     Keep you safe and warm

     This bond between us
     Can't be broken
     I will be here
     Don't you cry

    'Cause you'll be in my heart
     Yes, you'll be in my heart
     From this day on
     Now and forever more

     You'll be in my heart
     No matter what they say
     You'll be here in my heart always

     Why can't they understand the way we feel?
     They just don't trust what they can't explain
     I know we're different but deep inside us
     We're not that different at all

     And you'll be in my heart
     Yes, you'll be in my heart
     From this day on
     Now and forever more

     Don't listen to them
    'Cause what do they know (what do they know)?
     We need each other
     To have, to hold
     They'll see in time
     I know

     When destiny calls you
     You must be strong (you gotta be strong)
     I may not be with you
     But you've got to hold on
     They'll see in time
     I know
     We'll show them together

    'Cause you'll be in my heart
     Believe me, you'll be in my heart
     I'll be there from this day on
     Now and forever more

     Oh, you'll be in my heart (you'll be here in my heart)
     No matter what they say (I'll be with you)
     You'll be here in my heart (I'll be there) always

     Always
     I'll be with you
     I'll be there for you always
     Always and always
     Just look over your shoulder
     Just look over your shoulder
     Just look over your shoulder
     I'll be there always

    <h3>INFORMATION OF THE SONG</h3>
<ul>
    <b><li>Artist:</b> By Phil Collins</li>
    <b><li>Film:</b> Tarzan-1999, Walt Disney animated feature</li>
    <b><li>Original Soundtrack:</b> Tarzan: An Original Walt Disney Records Soundtrack, which includes songs by Phil Collins and the instrumental score by Mark Mancina.</li>
    <b><li>Release Date:</b> June 15, 1999</li>
    <b><li>Songwriter:</b> Phil Collins</li>
    <b><li>Producers:</b> Phil Collins, Rob Cavallo</li>
    <b><li>Genre:</b> It is usually categorized in Pop / Pop Rock / Adult Contemporary ballad style. It has cinematic / soundtrack elements.</li>
    <b><li>Vocals:</b> Lead vocals by Phil Collins.Part of the song (in film) is sung by Kala (Glenn Close) to baby Tarzan.</li>
    <b><li>Lyrical Content:</b> The song is about a protective love — especially a parent (or adoptive parent) to child. The lyrics promise safety, comfort, that the bond of love will last “from this day on, now and forever more.”</li>
    <b><li>Musical Style:</b> Soft, emotive ballad form, with piano / keyboards, orchestral strings, percussion, and a strong lullaby feel. The rhythm and instrumentation are designed to evoke warmth, protection, and a maternal bond; some “jungle beat” per Disney’s request for the Tarzan soundtrack.</li>
    <b><li>Performance in Film:</b> The song is used in the early part of the film: when Kala comforts young Tarzan; that is the portion where the character voice (Kala) sings. In the film proper, the song is truncated (only part is used), but the full studio version appears in the soundtrack and in closing credits.</li>
    <b><li>Commercial Performance:</b> Chart Positions: US Billboard Hot 100: peaked at #21. US Adult Contemporary: it was #1 on Adult Contemporary charts for many weeks. UK Singles Chart: reached #17. Soundtrack Album Performance:The Tarzan soundtrack reached #5 on the Billboar. It was certified double platinum in the U.S. (for the full soundtrack).</li>
    <b><li>Awards and Recognition:</b> Academy Award (Oscar) for Best Original Song — won in 2000. Golden Globe Award — Best Original Song. Grammy nomination for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media. The film soundtrack Trzan also won a Grammy for Best Soundtrack Album.</li>
    <b><li>Remix:</b> Phil Collins recorded the song in multiple languages beyond English: Spanish (“En mi corazón vivirás”), German (“Dir Gehört Mein Herz”), French, Italian, etc. There is a version where Glenn Close (as Kala) sings part. There is a demo version (Collins singing with piano) included as bonus in special editions of Tarzan. If by remix you mean official remixes (dance versions / reworkings), I didn’t find a major commercial remix release noted in the sources I checked. The primary alternate versions are linguistic, character-voice, and demo/studio versions.</li>
</ul>
